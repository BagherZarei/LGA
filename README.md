# Learning-Based Genetic Algorithm (LGA) for Community Detection Problem (CDP)

1) This repository contains the MATLAB codes and datasets (networks) used in paper 'Identifying Communities in Complex Networks Using Learning-Based Genetic Algorithm'.

2) Set the network path and algorithm parameters from file 'Main.m' inside 'Matlab Codes' folder and then run it. 
    
3) Use MATLAB version R2022a or higher
